Simple Weather App
A simple, user-friendly web application that provides current weather data for any city. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app fetches live weather information from an external API, displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Features
City Search: Users can search for the weather by entering a city name.
Current Weather Data: Displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
Temperature Units: Option to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
Error Handling: If the city is not found or the API call fails, an error message is shown.
Demo
You can view the live demo of the Simple Weather App [here](URL to live demo, if applicable).

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web application.
CSS: For styling the user interface, ensuring the app is visually appealing and mobile-friendly.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for fetching weather data, managing user input, and dynamically updating the UI.
Weather API: Fetches current weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
How to Use
Search for a City: Type the name of the city in the search bar and press the "Search" button or hit Enter.
View Weather Data: The app will display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the selected city.
Change Temperature Unit: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit by clicking the unit button.
Installation
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd simple-weather-app
Open index.html in your preferred browser.
No server-side setup is required. The project is entirely client-side and communicates with a weather API to fetch real-time data.
API Key Setup (If Applicable)
If you're using an API that requires an API key (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), you will need to:

Sign up for an API key from your chosen weather API provider.

In the JavaScript file (script.js), replace the API_KEY placeholder with your actual API key:

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Ensure the API URL in the JavaScript code is set up correctly to query the weather data.
Customization:
You can easily customize the app by modifying the following files:
index.html: Update the structure of the page and add any new sections or features.
style.css: Adjust the styling to change the appearance of the weather app, including layout, colors, fonts, and more.
script.js: Update the logic for fetching data, adding new weather information, or integrating different weather APIs.
